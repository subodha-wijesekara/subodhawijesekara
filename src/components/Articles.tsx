        excerpt: "AI is no longer a separate domain reserved for data scientists. It is rapidly becoming an integral part of the modern software development lifecycle.",
        date: "Dec 2024",
        content: "Full-stack development has always evolved alongside new tools, frameworks, and paradigms. From monolithic applications to microservices, and from simple HTML pages to highly interactive web platforms, the role of a full-stack developer has continuously expanded. Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the next major shift reshaping how applications are built, tested, deployed, and maintained.",

        excerpt: "In today’s fast-moving web ecosystem, developers and businesses are no longer satisfied with just “working” applications. Performance, SEO, scalability, and developer experience have become critical success factors.",
        date: "Dec 2025",
        content: "One of the biggest reasons behind Next.js’s popularity is its focus on performance. Features like automatic code splitting, image optimization, and incremental static regeneration (ISR) ensure that users receive fast-loading pages without extra configuration. Pages load only the JavaScript they need, reducing bundle size and improving overall speed — especially important for mobile users.",

        date: "Nov 2024",
        content: "As frontend applications grow, managing complexity becomes a primary challenge. Monorepos, using tools like Turborepo or Nx, offer a solution by allowing you to share code, configurations, and types across multiple projects.\n\nKey strategies for scaling include enforcing strict boundaries between features, using a design system library, and automating code quality checks. This ensures that as the team and codebase grow, velocity doesn't suffer.",
